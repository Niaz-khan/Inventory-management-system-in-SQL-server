Project: Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Inventory Management System
Description:

This repository contains an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for an inventory management system. The ERD visually represents the entities (tables) and their relationships within the system.

Entities:

Supplier: Stores information about suppliers.
Supply: Manages the relationship between suppliers and products.
ProductCategory: Categorizes products.
Product: Details product information.
Store: Information about stores.
Customer: Customer details.
OrderTbl: Order information.
Shipping: Shipping details.
Invoice: Invoice information.
Relationships:

A supplier can supply multiple products.
A product belongs to a product category.
A product can be stored in multiple stores.
A customer can place multiple orders.
An order can contain multiple products.
An order is shipped to a specific address.
An invoice is generated for an order.
Notes:

The ERD is a static representation and does not include implementation details.
The ERD can be used as a reference for database design and development.
Future Improvements:

Consider adding attributes to entities for better data representation.
Explore normalization to optimize the database design.
Implement the ERD using a database management system (DBMS) for testing and development.
